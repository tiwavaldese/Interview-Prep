# Jude and Ben BMI

Instructions:

Coding challenge 1 Jude and Ben are trying to compare their BMI(Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 or BMI = mass/ (height * height), ( mass in kg and height in meters) Your tasks: 1. Store Jude's and Ben's mass and height in variables 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions) 3. Create a Boolean variable 'judeHigherBMI' containing information about whether Jude has a higher BMI than Ben. Test data: * Data 1: Jude weights 78kg and is 1.69m tall. Ben weights 92kg and is 1.95m tall. * Data 2: Jude weights 95kg and is 1.88m tall. Ben weights 85kg and is 1.76m tall.

# Tip Calculator

Instructions:

Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%. Your tasks: 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!) 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25” Test data: § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430 Hints: § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2 § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 😉
